VJ TYPEFACES
============

Only works on Processing 2 (or newer).


Library dependancies:

- Peasycam
- Geomerative


Typefaces:

This sketch only provides a few free or open source typefaces, but you can add better quality TTF file in the data folder (or use your own typefaces). Don't forget to update the setup function to let Processing find the right file.
